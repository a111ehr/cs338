List of Deliverables:
What is it? (general overview)
Who created it? Why? When? Where? How (what resources were used, language of code, with what knowledge)?
Who did it affect? How? What were the consequences? Was there any monetary loss? Data loss? Software or hardware damage?
How exactly does it work?
How did the software got copied from machine to machine?
How did the software get executed once it was copied to a new machine?
Why was it successful in causing chaos? Was anyone able to stop it or is it still an ongoing issue today?
This virus was spread via email--have email protocols or protections been changed since 2004 to prevent this kind of malware spread? --> How have we improved email security since 2004?
Is there a way to prevent it or spot it now before any damage is done? (like how there is virus protection nowadays, is there something similar for this type of malware)
Why should we be concerned about this type of malware?
